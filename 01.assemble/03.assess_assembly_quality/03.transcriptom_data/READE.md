### use transcriptom data to assess the assembly quality include:
   1. split scaffold and generate the sh file of blat
   2. Table: Assessment of the quality of the P. ilicifolia genome assembly using P. euphratica and P. pruinosa expressed sequence tags (ESTs) data. The ESTs were aligned on the assembled scaffolds using BLAT with an identity cutoff of 95%.
